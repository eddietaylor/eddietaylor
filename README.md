- 👋 Hi, I’m Eddie Taylor! My background is in physics and I finished my PhD in experimental plasma physics in 2019. I currently work as a pricing operations research analyst and have four years experience in revene management problems.  
- 👀 I’m interested in dynamic pricing, time series forecasting, numerical optimization, anomaly detection, stochastic modelling and generalized additive models
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nonparametric regression techniques, two staged regression, double machine learning and demand estimation!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on demand estimation modelling in the context of retail, airline, hotel or rental car problems. In addition, any problems in the algorithmic trading space and extracting alpha using ML and statistical modelling techniques!
